Environment Setup
=================
1. Install mongodb
2. Configure a user and a password for mongo against the admin database.
3. virtualenv env
4. source env/bin/activate
5. pip install -r requirements.txt (make sure to install the right version of mongomock as mentioned below)
6. Copy config/config.ini.template to /etc/garpr/config.ini and fill it out with a valid database/challonge config (the facebook section is not needed for tests and can be left with the dummy config).

Versions issues
===============
mongomock was installed from master, not 2.0.0

    pip install git+https://github.com/vmalloc/mongomock.git@master

Importing Data
==============
Replace `garpr_db_dump_folder` with the path of the folder where the dump is stored. LIkewise, replace `admin` and `password` with the user and password you configured against your admin database.

	mongorestore garpr_db_dump_folder -u admin -p password

Running the API server
======================
This runs the server locally on port 3000 with the debug flag set

    python server.py 3000 True

Running the Angular app
=======================
Start a simple http server serving the pages in the `webapp` folder

	pushd webapp; python -m SimpleHTTPServer; popd

You probably want to change the `hostname` variable in `webapp/script.js` and set it to your local api server. It should look something like this.

	if (dev) {
	    var hostname = 'localhost:3000';
	}
	else {
	    var hostname = 'localhost:3000';
	}

Browse to localhost:8000 to view the application.


Running Tests
======================
This runs the tests. Make sure you are running mongod without authentification.

    bash run_tests.sh
